Tic Tac Toe in the Console Window

This is a small little weekend project I did, I was inspired by @ForrestKnight over on youtube and decided to try and remake his idea on my own.
This project is only about 100 lines of code.

The game is played entirely in the console window, it can check who wins, and you can play again from the console window without having to reset the project.

Features:
- Makes sure a player cannot place an X or O over a cell that has been placed in already.
- Checks if a player got three in a row either in the rows, columns, or diagonal.
